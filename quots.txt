  quot: 'I don\'t think I\'m supposed to boss other people around just because I\'m a so-called celebrity or star. I hate that when people act that way. No one deserves it. I\'ve seen it happen. I don\'t call those people out - they know who they are. Some enjoy that reputation.' }

  quot: 'I believe that every single one of us, celebrity or not, has a responsibility to get involved in trying to make a difference in the world. Our generation faces many challenges, some of which were passed on to us by the past generations, but it\'s up to us to find solutions today so that we don\'t keep passing our problems on.' }

  quot: 'You don\'t learn from successes; you don\'t learn from awards; you don\'t learn from celebrity; you only learn from wounds and scars and mistakes and failures. And that\'s the truth.' }

  quot: 'Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian would have left little more than lipstick stains in their passing had it not been for the sex videos that lofted them into reality-TV notoriety. Once notoriety has warmed into familiarity, celebrity itself becomes one big \'Brady Bunch\' reunion, or a therapy session with Dr. Drew.' }

  quot: 'The only thing that\'s different between high profile or celebrity divorces is that you have to do all you can to keep your client and the details out of the media.' }

  quot: 'It\'s not like I\'m hanging out at shopping malls or going to celebrity golf tournaments. I\'m so in my own little world. I got my dog, my music, my brother, a couple of friends.' }

  quot: 'Everyone has their own path in life, no matter if it\'s being a celebrity or a singer. Quite frankly, I didn\'t move to Nashville and tell myself I wanted to be a singer because I wanted to be a celebrity or I wanted to be somebody that people admired. I wasn\'t about that. I just loved music.' }

  quot: 'I find it weird the way people get so excited about celebrity. If my friends are on the phone, their friends will say: \'Is that kid from \'Love Actually\' there?\' And the phone gets passed round and I have to speak to this stranger asking: \'Are you famous?\' I don\'t know how to answer.' }

  quot: 'I think a lot of people get lost. They start following iconic figures and get drowned in the pool of celebrity. Our society, as we know it, is definitely changing. With social media and cell phones, you freak out when you don\'t know what\'s going on.' }

  quot: 'I don\'t go to celebrity parties a lot. I don\'t really enjoy them because I really like going for it in parties. And sometimes at celebrity parties, there is no dancing on tables because people... it can be a little judgmental at times. So I tend not to go unless it is Taylor Swift\'s birthday party; then it\'s amazing.' }
